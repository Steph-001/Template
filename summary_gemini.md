Okay, break time is a great idea! This has been a very productive, but detailed session.

You are absolutely right â€“ if we start a completely fresh chat, I won't have the history of this specific conversation. The context of the specific errors we fixed, the evolution of the shortcodes, and the reasoning behind the current homepage strategy would be lost.

So, summarizing is an excellent way to preserve that context and give you clear steps for when you resume.

**Summary of Our Conversation (Hugo/Docsy Customization)**

1.  **Goal:** Make media display consistently, customize navigation, and create a custom homepage layout on your Docsy-themed Hugo site.
2.  **Shortcode Enhancements:**
    - We successfully modified your shortcodes (`pdf.html`, `local-video.html`, `responsive-image.html`, `fullscreen-image.html`, `gallery.html`) to:
      - Accept a `max_width` parameter for consistent maximum width control.
      - Accept an `align` parameter (`center`/`left`) for positioning.
      - Prioritize finding media within **Page Bundles** (using filenames like `image.jpg` in Markdown calls when the file is in the same folder) instead of relying on `/static`.
    - For `pdf.html` and `local-video.html`, we implemented a CSS aspect-ratio technique to prevent poster images or default rendering from causing sizing issues, ensuring they scale correctly based on width.
    - For `gallery.html`, we implemented the Page Bundle logic (looking in a `gallery/` subfolder), added `max_width` and `align`, and integrated the fullscreen modal feature from `fullscreen-image.html` using JavaScript event delegation.
    - We addressed various parsing errors related to Go Template comments and function syntax (`substr`).
3.  **Homepage Layout:**
    - **Goal:** Create a homepage with a static Welcome section, followed by the 3 latest "News" posts, and a link to the main News page. Hide "News" from the left sidebar nav.
    - **Method:**
      - Hide "News" section from sidebar using `toc_hide: true` in `content/news/_index.md`.
      - Keep `type: docs` in `content/_index.md` front matter (as removing it broke overall page styling/functionality).
      - Override the layout file Hugo uses for `type: docs` list pages (likely `layouts/docs/list.html`) by copying it to your project.
      - **Current Step:** Edit _your copy_ of `layouts/docs/list.html` to replace its default content rendering logic within the `{{ define "main" }}` block with the custom HTML/Hugo code for the Welcome section and the News post loop.
4.  **Left Sidebar Navigation (TOC):**
    - Established that Docsy's sidebar is built from content structure, not `hugo.yaml` menus.
    - Determined the method for adding custom/external links: Create dummy `.md` files within the desired section folder (e.g., `/content/external-links/`), using `manualLink` and `_build: render: never` front matter.
    - Determined the method for adding separators: Requires the same dummy file approach but also needs an override of the `layouts/partials/sidebar-tree.html` partial to check for a custom front matter flag (e.g., `is_separator: true`) and render an `<hr>` or styled element.
5.  **Miscellaneous:**
    - Troubleshot and fixed Emmet HTML expansion in VS Code for Markdown files (`emmet.includeLanguages`).
    - Discussed using Bootstrap utility classes (`<span class="text-primary fw-bold">`) to style text within Markdown.
    - Discussed how Bootstrap cards fill parent width by default when specific width classes (`w-75`) are removed.

**Action Points for Tomorrow (Picking Up Where We Left Off):**

1.  **Confirm Homepage Layout File:** Double-check the exact path of the layout file Docsy uses for list pages of `type: docs`. It's most likely `themes/docsy/layouts/docs/list.html`. If that doesn't exist, check `themes/docsy/layouts/_default/list.html`.
2.  **Copy Layout Override:** Ensure you have copied that identified `list.html` file into your project at the corresponding path (e.g., `YOUR_PROJECT/layouts/docs/list.html`).
3.  **Edit Your Copied `list.html`:**
    - Open your copy (e.g., `layouts/docs/list.html`).
    - Locate the `{{ define "main" }}` block.
    - Identify the code within that block that currently renders the default content (likely `{{ .Content }}`, possibly near an `<h1>{{ .Title }}</h1>`).
    - **Replace** that default content-rendering code with the custom homepage code block provided in the previous answer (the one containing the `<section class="row td-box...">` for Welcome and the `<section class="latest-news...">` for the news loop). **Be careful** to keep the `{{ define "main" }}` and `{{ end }}` tags and any other surrounding structural HTML or Hugo logic that seems part of the overall page structure (like title rendering).
4.  **Restart and Test:** Stop `hugo server`, restart it, and hard-refresh your browser's homepage. It should now show the custom Welcome message and the latest news posts, using the overall Docsy page structure (header, footer, sidebars) because `type: docs` is still set on `content/_index.md`.
5.  **(If Gallery Styling Missing):** Remember to add the final CSS rules for the `gallery-container` flexbox layout to your `assets/scss/_styles_project.scss` file if you haven't already done so and cleared the CSS cache.

This summary and action plan should provide a solid context anchor for you to pick things up smoothly tomorrow. Rest well!
